# Description
Experimental simulation environment for drone navigation with MoveIt!, 2D Lidar and ultrasonic sensors.

## Project Overview
The modified version of the MoveIt! planning framework is used in this project to support aerial navigation, using OMPL's path planning algorithms for three-dimensional path planning, integrating it with the drone's control system.
ArduPilot SITL is used for simulating the flight controller of the drone and MAVROS is used as a bridge between ROS nodes and the flight controller.
